# `ft_printf` - Custom Implementation of the Standard `printf` Function

## Overview

`ft_printf` is a custom implementation of the standard `printf` function from the C standard library. It allows formatted output of various data types (such as integers, strings, and characters) to the standard output (stdout). The function accepts a format string and a variable number of arguments, making it flexible and versatile for various types of formatted output. By implementing `ft_printf`, you gain a deeper understanding of how variadic functions and format specifiers work in C.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Variadic Functions**
`ft_printf` is a **variadic function**, which means it can accept a variable number of arguments. In C, this is achieved using the `<stdarg.h>` library, which provides macros (`va_start`, `va_arg`, `va_end`) to handle the variable arguments. 

- **`va_start`** initializes the variable argument list.
- **`va_arg`** extracts the next argument from the list.
- **`va_end`** ends the processing of variable arguments.

This allows `ft_printf` to be highly flexible, processing any number and type of arguments passed in the function call.

### 2. **Format Specifiers**
The core functionality of `ft_printf` revolves around **format specifiers**. These are placeholders in the format string (e.g., `%d`, `%s`, `%c`) that dictate how the corresponding arguments should be formatted and displayed. 

Common format specifiers include:
- `%d`: Integer (decimal)
- `%s`: String
- `%c`: Character
- `%x`: Unsigned hexadecimal
- `%p`: Pointer

Each specifier is associated with a specific function or method in `ft_printf` that handles the printing of that particular type of data.

### 3. **Handling Different Data Types**
To support different types of data, `ft_printf` must handle various conversions:
- **Integers:** Both signed and unsigned integers are printed with specifiers like `%d` or `%u`. Functions like `ft_print_digit` handle integer formatting.
- **Strings and Characters:** String (`%s`) and character (`%c`) formatting is done using helper functions like `ft_print_string` and `ft_print_char`.
- **Pointers:** The `%p` specifier is used to print a memory address (pointer), which is formatted as a hexadecimal number with the `ft_print_pointer` function.

### 4. **Number Formatting**
For number-related format specifiers (like `%d`, `%u`, `%x`), `ft_printf` typically involves converting numbers to strings using a specific base (e.g., decimal, hexadecimal). This process is often handled by a helper function that takes the number and its base, converts it to a string representation, and then prints it.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization:** The function first processes the format string to identify format specifiers.
2. **Processing Arguments:** For each format specifier, `ft_printf` uses the corresponding function to format the argument and output it.
3. **Output:** The formatted results are printed to the standard output using system calls like `write` (via `ft_putchar` or `ft_putstr`).

## Example Usage

```c
ft_printf("Hello, world! This is an integer: %d\n", 123);
ft_printf("A string: %s\n", "Test string");
ft_printf("Character: %c\n", 'X');
